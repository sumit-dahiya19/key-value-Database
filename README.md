# key-Value-Database
It a implementation of key-value database using python that perform create , read and delete operations 

Problem: Build a file based key-value data store that support 
->create 
->read 
->delete

operations , the data stored must be locally stored in the system .

The database is stored locally in json format I have taken 2 databases, one is master database and the other is temporary database 
temporary data will store all the operations for one single process .
